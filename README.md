# vue3-and-spring-boot-sample
Sample with Vue 3, Spring Boot, Docker Postgres, and Spring Docker support

A hacking-around project that I'll keep updating as I experiment with various features. 
Not much to look at right now, unless you want to see a Spring Boot WebFlux REST endpoint
and a simple Vue form posting to it.
